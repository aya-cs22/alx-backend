# 0x00 - Pagination

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing pagination techniques to efficiently handle and navigate large datasets. It covers several methods of pagination and their application in RESTful APIs.

## Resources

To understand the concepts covered in this project, you may refer to the following resources:

- [REST API Design: Pagination](https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/REST-API-Design-Filtering-Sorting-and-Pagination/#pagination)

- [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. **Paginate a Dataset with Simple Page and Page Size Parameters**:
   - Implement basic pagination using `page` and `page_size` parameters to manage large datasets.

2. **Paginate a Dataset with Hypermedia Metadata**:
   - Use hypermedia metadata to provide navigational links and additional context in paginated responses.

3. **Paginate in a Deletion-Resilient Manner**:
   - Ensure pagination remains accurate and consistent even when data entries are deleted or modified.

## Setup

To get started with this project, use the provided data file:

- **File**: `Popular_Baby_Names.csv`

This file contains the dataset you'll work with to implement pagination techniques.
