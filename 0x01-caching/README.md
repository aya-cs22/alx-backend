# 0x01. Caching

## Project Overview

In this project, you will explore various caching algorithms to understand their principles and applications. Caching systems are vital for improving performance and efficiency in computing systems by storing frequently accessed data.

## Resources

To understand the concepts covered in this project, you may refer to the following resources:

- [Cache replacement policies - FIFO ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#First_In_First_Out_%28FIFO%29)

- [Cache replacement policies - LIFO ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Last_In_First_Out_%28LIFO%29)

- [Cache replacement policies - LRU ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_Recently_Used_%28LRU%29)

- [Cache replacement policies - MRU ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_Recently_Used_%28LRU%29)

- [Cache replacement policies - LFU ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least-Frequently_Used_%28LFU%29)



## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

What a caching system is: A system designed to store and manage frequently accessed data to speed up retrieval and reduce load on the main data source.

What FIFO means: "First In, First Out" - A cache management strategy where the oldest data is removed first.

What LIFO means: "Last In, First Out" - A cache management strategy where the most recently added data is removed first.

What LRU means: "Least Recently Used" - A cache management strategy where the data that has not been used for the longest time is removed first.

What MRU means: "Most Recently Used" - A cache management strategy where the most recently accessed data is removed first.

What LFU means: "Least Frequently Used" - A cache management strategy where the data that has been accessed the least number of times is removed first.

The purpose of a caching system: To improve performance by storing frequently accessed data for faster retrieval and reducing the load on primary data sources.

The limits of a caching system: Constraints include limited storage capacity, potential data staleness, synchronization issues, and challenges in choosing the right eviction strategy
